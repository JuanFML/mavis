Instructions for Building the User Manual
-------------------------------------------

The user manual contains instructions for running the tool, background theory,
api documentation, and guidelines for contributors. To build the user manual
python3 is required as well as other python modules listed in the requirements.txt
file. To install the required modules, use the python package manager, pip.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

The user manual can then be built

    cd docs/
    make html

This will create the user manual in html. Open the docs/build/html/index.html file in an
internet browser (i.e. chrome, firefox, etc.) to explore the documentation

    open docs/build/html/index.html


Instructions for Running the Unit Tests
----------------------------------------

Unit tests for this package are run with nose and should be run from the top level directory. You will
need to have installed the python dependencies before running tests. The following command will run
the unit tests and compute the test coverage for the main package.

    nosetests --with-coverage --cover-html --cover-html-dir=coverage --cover-package=mavis --cover-erase

Dependencies
----------------

Other than python3 and the python packages listed in the requirements.txt file, the tool also requires samtools (for
sorting and indexing the output bam files) and an aligner. Currently the only aligner supported is blat. Testing
was performed using BLAT v.36x2
