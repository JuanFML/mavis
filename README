Instructions for Building the User Manual
-------------------------------------------

The user manual contains instructions for running the tool, background theory,
api documentation, and guidelines for contributors. To build the user manual
python3 is required as well as other python modules listed in the requirements.txt
file. To install the required modules, use the python package manager, pip.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

The user manual can then be built

    cd docs/
    make html

This will create the user manual in html. Open the docs/build/html/index.html file in an
internet browser (i.e. chrome, firefox, etc.) to explore the documentation

    open docs/build/html/index.html
